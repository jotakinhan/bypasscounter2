# bypasscounter2
Passer-by counter made during an IOT-course in Haaga-Helia university. This version also recognizes by RFID-tag, whether the bypasser is a customer or staff(for example). Information about bypasses is sent here using a python3 script.
RFID reader code is based on an example by https://hobbycomponents.com/(https://community.particle.io/t/getting-the-rfid-rc522-to-work-solved/3571/3).
Mark Laatikainenâ€™s RFID project(https://github.com/marklaatikainen/IoT-workshop/blob/master/iot_tyo.ino) has also been studied to get this working.

Based on my earlier project(https://github.com/jotakinhan/bypasscounter) in which i collaborated with Juha Kulmala(https://jkmala.wordpress.com/2017/03/24/ohikulkusensori-iot-projekti/).
Teacher: Tero Karvinen(http://terokarvinen.com/2017/create-interent-of-things-for-8-eur-esp8266-12e-and-arduino).

Created based on an example and a library found here:(https://community.particle.io/t/getting-the-rfid-rc522-to-work-solved/3571/3).
Published according to these statements found there:

"This is an example of how to use the RC522 RFID module. The module allows reading
and writing to various types of RFID devices and can be found in our MFRC-522 
(HCMODU0016) and Ultimate RFID (HCARDU0068) kits. This example Arduino sketch uses
the RFID library written by Miguel Balboa to read the pre-programmed serial number 
from RFID cards and tags supplied with our RFID kits. Snapshots and links to the 
library are available on our support forum."
